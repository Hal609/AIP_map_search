# TODO
## 1. Implement All Search Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Progress      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Breadth-First Search (**BFS**) | ‚úÖ |
| Depth-First Search (**DFS**) | ‚úÖ |
| Uniform Cost Search (**UCS**) | ‚úÖ |
| A Search (**A\***) | ‚úÖ |

## 2. Tree Search and Graph Search

- Tree Search: Explore all nodes without checking if a node has been visited before.
- Graph Search: Use a closed set to track visited nodes and avoid revisiting. ‚úÖ
- If a node is already visited, check if a faster path to the node has been found and update accordingly.
- Record the following for each version:
    - Path found ‚úÖ
    - Time elapsed ‚úÖ
    - Path cost ‚úÖ


##  3. Path Visualisation ‚úÖ
- Search exploration (e.g., paths explored). 
- The final path found (different colors for clarity). 
- e.g.:
    - Yellow lines: Path exploration history. 
    - Red: Start state. 
    - Magenta: Goal state. 
    - Use Matplotlib to display results on the grid. 


## 4. Compare Algorithms

- Run several searches (without visualisation) and log: the time ‚úÖ and memory ‚ùå used. 
- Graph the time and space complexity of the algorithms ‚úÖ
- Create a comparison table with the following metrics:
    - Time taken to compute the path. ‚úÖ
    - Path length (number of moves).
    - Path cost.
    - Memory/storage usage.

| Algorithm |  Time (ms)  | Path Length | Path Cost | Memory Usage | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |------------- |
| BFS       | 10828.48228 |             |           |              | 
| DFS       | 462.78136   |             |           |              | 
| UCS       |             |             |           |              | 
| A*        | 1.87983     |             |           |              |    

## 5. Code Formatting and Structure

- Fully comment and document the code. üü°
- Describe the function of the algorithms in docstrings.
- Make the visuals pretty. ‚úÖ
- Write a proper README.
